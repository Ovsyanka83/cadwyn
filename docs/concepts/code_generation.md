# Code generation

Cadwyn generates versioned schemas and everything related to them from latest version. These versioned schemas will be automatically used in requests and responses for [versioned API routes](./main_app.md#main-app). There are two methods of generating code: using a function and using the CLI:

## Command-line interface

You can use `cadwyn codegen` which accepts a python path to your version bundle.

**NOTE** that it is not a regular system path. It's the **python-style** path -- the same one you would use when running `uvicorn` through command-line. Imagine that you are importing the module and then appending `":" + version_bundle_variable_name` at the end.

```bash
cadwyn codegen path.to.version.bundle:version_bundle_variable
```

**Note that:**

* You don't use the system path style for both arguments. Instead, imagine that you are importing these modules in python -- that's the way you want to write down the paths.
* Take a look at how we point to our version bundle. We use ":" to say that it's a variable within the specified module

## Function interface

You can use `cadwyn.generate_code_for_versioned_packages` which accepts a `template_module` (a directory which contains the latest versions) and `versions` which is the `VersionBundle` from which to generate versions.
